  <strong>An unofficial Eden emulator port for PlayStation 5 homebrew</strong>
</p>

**ProsperoEden is an unofficial PlayStation 5 port of [Eden](https://github.com/eden-emulator/mirror)** - an accurate, high-performance emulator. All credit for the emulator core belongs to the Eden project and its contributors. ProsperoEden is not affiliated with or endorsed by the Eden team or Sony.

This is an early alpha. Video, audio, controller input, and saves have been confirmed working. Compatibility and performance will vary between games. The current release is **v1.000.010**.

## 🚧 Source code coming soon

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The ProsperoEden source code will be published soon.** We are still completing performance enhancements, polishing the user interface, and preparing the project for a clean public source release. The current alpha package is available for early testing while this work continues.

## Project foundation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Built on the [PS5 Native App Boilerplate](https://github.com/blackbearreloaded/ps5-native-app-boilerplate), the same native foundation used by ProsperoLight.**
> It provides the native PS5 application structure, runtime, packaging, RmlUi shell, and homebrew deployment foundation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Graphics are powered by [ps5-opengl](https://github.com/blackbearreloaded/ps5-opengl).**
> This OpenGL implementation provides the native PS5 rendering layer used by the Eden graphics backend.

## Install

1. Download and extract the release ZIP.
2. Copy the included `PPSA99008` folder to `/data/homebrew/PPSA99008` on the PS5.
3. Supply your own legally dumped keys, firmware, and games using the paths below.
4. Launch **ProsperoEden** and open **Library**. Setup is checked when the app opens; after adding or replacing keys or firmware, close and reopen it.

The final layout should look like this:

```text
/data/homebrew/PPSA99008/
├── assets/
│   ├── keys/
│   │   ├── prod.keys
│   │   └── title.keys                 # optional
│   ├── firmware/
│   │   └── *.nca                      # extracted firmware NCAs
│   └── roms/
│       ├── Game.nsp
│       └── Game.xci
├── eboot.bin
└── ...
```

ProsperoEden does not include keys, firmware, games, or other copyrighted console data. Dump these files from hardware and software you own. Do not download or redistribute them.

If upgrading from the first alpha, move your firmware `.nca` files from `assets/nand/system/Contents/registered/` to `assets/firmware/`. Leave your `assets/keys/` and `assets/roms/` files in place. The release ZIP contains no user files, so copy its app files over your installation without deleting your own data.

## Changes in v1.000.010

- Updated OpenGL rendering and performance, including multisample operations and render-target compatibility.
- Improved game loading and shutdown handling, including startup and return-to-launcher fixes.
- Added a per-game **Handheld / Docked** setting in game details. The selected mode applies on the next launch.
- Includes the normal launcher; no development autoboot or scripted input.

**Known issues:** Some demanding games remain very slow and may crash when exiting. Repeatedly switching games can still encounter stability problems. This is a testing pre-release, not a compatibility guarantee.

## In-game shortcuts

“Select” means pressing the DualSense touchpad itself, as in ProsperoLight.

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| Select + R1 | Toggle the performance HUD |
| Select + L1 | End the running game and return to the ROM menu |
