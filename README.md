# ProsperoEden

**ProsperoEden is an unofficial PlayStation 5 port of [Eden](https://github.com/eden-emulator/mirror).** All credit for the emulator core belongs to the Eden project and its contributors. ProsperoEden is not affiliated with or endorsed by the Eden team or Sony.

This is an early alpha. Video, audio, controller input, and saves have been confirmed working. Compatibility and performance will vary between games.

## Install

1. Download and extract the release ZIP.
2. Copy the included `PPSA99008` folder to `/data/homebrew/PPSA99008` on the PS5.
3. Supply your own legally dumped keys, firmware, and games using the paths below.
4. Launch **ProsperoEden** and choose **Load ROM**.

The final layout should look like this:

```text
/data/homebrew/PPSA99008/
├── assets/
│   ├── keys/
│   │   ├── prod.keys
│   │   └── title.keys                 # optional
│   ├── nand/system/Contents/registered/
│   │   └── *.nca                      # your dumped firmware
│   └── roms/
│       ├── Game.nsp
│       └── Game.xci

```
